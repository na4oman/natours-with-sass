# Natours with CSS and SASS

This is the first project in Jonas Schmedtmann Udemy course [Advanced CSS and SASS](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/).  
The main goal of the project is using Sass: setting global variables, building for reusability, architecting CSS: the 7-1 rule, component-based design, the BEM methodology, writing reusable, maintainable, and scalable code, and managing media queries.
It also contains a lot of advanced CSS features: animations with @keyframes, animation, and transition, advanced CSS selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements.
